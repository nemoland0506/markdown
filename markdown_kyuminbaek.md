species-the adaptable and mobile Terrans, the ever-evolving insectoid Zerg, the powerfully enigmatic Protoss, and the "god-like" 
Xel'Naga creator race-in a distant part of the Milky Way galaxy known as the Koprulu Sector. The series debuted with the video game 
StarCraft in 1998. Since then it has grown to include a number of other games as well as eight novelizations, two Amazing Stories 
articles, a board game, and other licensed merchandise such as collectible statues and toys.
